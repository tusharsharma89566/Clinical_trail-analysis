## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide a toolkit for analyzing clinical trial datasets. It is designed to help researchers and data scientists:
- Clean and preprocess clinical data
- Perform statistical analysis on clinical endpoints
- Visualize key trends and outcomes
- Generate reproducible reports

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing utilities
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) scripts
- Statistical analysis modules (t-tests, ANOVA, regression, etc.)
- Visualization tools for clinical trial metrics
- Jupyter notebooks with example workflows

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tusharsharma89566/Clinical_trail-analysis.git
   cd Clinical_trail-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Place your clinical trial dataset (CSV/Excel format) in the `data/` directory.
- Edit the configuration files or scripts as needed to point to your data.
- Run analysis scripts or open the provided Jupyter notebooks for guided analysis.

Example (running a Jupyter notebook):

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open the desired notebook in your browser.
